# Firmware
Repetier firmware for all RAMBo controlled SeeMeCNC 3D Printers. One firmware, configuarable for all RAMBo deltas. 

This firmware is based off of Repetier Firmware, through many years and versions, as well as some integration with features of marlin and others work.  

#Forks Comments
This fork adds support for E3Dv6 hot-end and magnet ball and carbon fiber arms. I plan to include updates for the HE280 probe with the E3Dv6 hot-end.
